                            <p>After I finished my Informatic Systems Management and Programming Technician course in my school, I tried to find ways to enter college but I couldn´t. While I was looking for ways I could develop my knowledge in the area web developer, I took another jobs to have other type of experiences. First, I was at Caracteres e Simetrias, a construction work company that me and my father built. My father who is experienced in the area was showing and teaching more about the area, but I never got really excited about it. After entering my course in IPCA, I went back to Caracteres E Simetrias, this time as a driver which I am still doing to this day.</p>

                            <p>Then on September 2019, I started working in "Brasmar", a company based in seafood and there I worked as night-time cleaner where I cleaned machines denominated as "tunnels" where the seafood would go through during daytime. After a year in Brasmar, I aplied for a Multimedia and Web Developer course in IPCA and when I got notified that I entered it and knowing that I couldn´t be working night time with the course also being night time. So I also left Brasmar and went back to working with my dad in Caracteres E Simetrias</p>

                          <p>Take care, treat and evolve our clients and their companies to the best they could be. Our goal was to make your goal, no longer a goal but a reality. In this internship, I mostly worked with HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. I also used PHP but I had very few experience from it. It's the internship that made me realize what I wanted to do for a living and I had very good "internship teacher" named Tiago, who helped me a lot and teached about Git, Github & and Github Pages. I had an amazing opportunity and I think I gave it my best.</p>

I was only 16 at the time and the staff prefered to not allow me to work on the hardware of portable computer due me not having enough experience. I also had the fantastic opportunity to build a desktop computer from the ground and that was one of my goals since I started studying in the area. In terms of internship, this was definitely the best internship I had, mostly due to amazing people that accepted me even though I had very few to none experience.</p>
